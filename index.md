### E-Commerce Website Redesign 

I worked with a team of three engineers to update an outdated client-facing retail web-portal.  I architected a ratings and reviews module that allowed for viewing and submitting reviews for each product in the database.

### Old School:  An Accessible Video Sharing Platform for the Elderly

I worked in a team of 6 to create a video platform specificly for our older generation to share their wisdom and experiences.  Taking into account our target users, accessability for those users, and our time frame, we created exactly that. Users are able create profiles through google authentication, upload videos and blogs, favorite other creators and receive notifications when those creators upload, vote on video categories, and more!

### Encounters

In 2 days, I created a fullstack app to help fishermen journal, plan, and predict.  Here is my elevator pitch for its use case:

Fishing journals have been around a long time, but nobody wants to look up the weather and conditions.  However, whenever a fisherman catches something of note, they take a picture, especially musky fishing.  Overall, this behavior has been going on for about ten years since camera phones have become ubiquitous and now fishermen can look back at their pictures and find out why they were successful.

The game is this, musky fishing is based on precise knowledge of patterns with definite predictors such as moon phase and barometric pressure swings.  This app will help the fishermen keep track of this and set up their next big outing.  With a future upside for networking as man teams up against this apex predator, this has massive expansion opportunity, there are many vendors and potential clients that could advertise lures and gear, and also there are avenues for expansion into other types of fish or game.
