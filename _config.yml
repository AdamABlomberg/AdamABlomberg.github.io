  I am a full-stack software engineer who loves to solve problems.  During my time in public education I found that computer software and electronics in general fascinate me.

  Last year I decided to make the jump into computer software engineering and after extensive research selected Hack Reactor software engineering immersive program.  Through this experience, I learned full-stack development that includes Javascript, React, Express, Node, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, and AGILE framework.
